# WaniFi

Self-hosted dashboard for UniFi WAN failover monitoring with rule-based automation.

When your UniFi gateway switches to a failover WAN, WaniFi can automatically
stop/start Docker containers or run host commands. Handy for things like
pausing qBittorrent on 5G failover so you don't burn through mobile data.

## Features

- 📡 Polls a UniFi controller (UDM / UCG / UX) via the official API key
- 🐳 Controls Docker containers through the host's Docker socket
- 💻 Runs arbitrary shell commands on the Docker host (via `nsenter`)
- 🔁 Rule triggers: `failover`, `restored`, `down`, `high_latency`
- 📈 Live throughput / latency graphs with 1h to 30d ranges
- 🔔 Optional ntfy push notifications
- 🔐 Single-user login (bcrypt; first-run setup wizard)
- 💾 SQLite, no other services required

## Quick start

Create a folder for WaniFi, drop in a `compose.yaml`, and start it:

```bash
mkdir wanifi && cd wanifi
mkdir -p data
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheHef/WaniFI/main/compose.yaml
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. Docker pulls the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry
(`ghcr.io/thehef/wanifi`) and starts it on port `8765`. Open
`http://<docker-host>:8765` in a browser.

### compose.yaml

If you'd rather paste it yourself:

```yaml
name: wanifi

services:
  wanifi:
    image: ghcr.io/thehef/wanifi:latest
    container_name: wanifi
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8765:8000"
    environment:
      TZ: "Europe/Copenhagen"
    privileged: true
    pid: host
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

> `privileged: true` and `pid: host` are required so WaniFi can run host
> commands via `nsenter`. If you don't need host commands you can drop them
> both and stick to Docker container rules.

To update later: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

## Setup

### 1. Pick an admin password

On first visit you'll be redirected to `/setup` to choose an admin password.
The bcrypt hash is stored in the local SQLite database, no env vars needed.

### 2. Configure your UniFi controller

In the WaniFi UI go to **Settings**:

- **Controller URL:** `https://<your-UCG-or-UDM-IP>`
- **API Key:** generate one in UniFi OS → Settings → Control Plane →
  Integrations → API Keys (requires UniFi OS 3.x+)
- Click **Test Connection** and your WAN interfaces appear as draggable chips
- Drop one chip into **Primary WAN** and another into **Failover WAN**
- Give them friendly names and hit **Save**

### 3. Add rules

Rules tie a WAN event to an action. Examples:

- `qbittorrent` · *On failover* · *Pause container*
- `qbittorrent` · *On restored* · *Unpause container*
- Host command · *On high latency* · `systemctl restart smokeping`

## Events

Every state change, rule firing, error and manual action is logged. Filter
by level or search the message column; deletion is per-row or all-at-once.

## Building from source

If you'd rather hack on the code instead of using the published image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheHef/WaniFI.git
cd WaniFI
docker build -t wanifi:local .
```

Then point the `image:` field in your `compose.yaml` at `wanifi:local` and
run `docker compose up -d`.

```

A background task polls the UniFi controller, updates live stats for the
dashboard every 2 seconds, and detects WAN state changes to fire your rules.

## Security notes

- WaniFi runs with `privileged: true` and `pid: host` so it can use `nsenter`
  for host-command rules and Docker socket for container actions. This is
  effectively root on the host. **Only expose it on a trusted LAN.**
- If you must expose it externally, put it behind a reverse proxy with
  additional auth (Authelia, Pangolin, Cloudflare Tunnel + Access, etc.).
- API keys, ntfy tokens and the bcrypt password hash live in the SQLite
  database at `data/wanifi.db`. Back it up; it's the only secret.

## Updating

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Schema migrations run automatically on startup. New image versions are
published to `ghcr.io/thehef/wanifi` on every push to `main`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Stuck on `/setup` after restart:** the bcrypt hash lives in
  `data/wanifi.db`. If the bind mount is wrong it'll keep regenerating.
- **WAN detection wrong:** click **Debug** in Settings to dump live UniFi
  data to the browser console; verify your `primary_wan` / `failover_wan`
  match the `subsystem` field shown in the discovered chips.
- **Container `not found`:** rule containers must match `docker ps` names,
  not Compose service names.
